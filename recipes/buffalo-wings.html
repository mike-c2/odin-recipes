    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>10 chicken wings</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Whisk together flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Place chicken wings in a single layer in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle flour mixture over top and toss until wings are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>
          Add about 1 inch oil to a deep, heavy skillet; heat to 375 degrees F
          (190 degrees C). (The oil should be just enough to cover wings entirely.)
        </li>
        <li>
          While the oil is coming to temperature, combine butter, hot sauce, pepper,
          and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat.
        </li>
        <li>Cook and stir until butter is melted and mixture is thoroughly blended.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and reserve for serving.</li>
        <li>
          Fry coated wings in the hot oil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they begin
          to crisp and turn brown. Maintain the oil temperature while cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Remove wings from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>
          Transfer wings to a platter and drizzle hot sauce over top; or mix
          wings and hot sauce in a bowl until coated. Serve.
        </li>
